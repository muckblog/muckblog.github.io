In an effort to clean up some space in my Google Drive, I’ve recently been going through some old documents and files on there to see what’s bin-worthy. And as it turns out, there was quite a bit - random old JFS clips, podcast recordings and zipped photo albums. To the trash they go!

But partway through my digital housekeeping, I stumbled across some Google Sheets files and suddenly remembered that here is where all my old questionnaires and responses are saved. And sure enough there they all were - ancient Q&A series submissions (questions that are nearing a decade old at this point!), favourite moment suggestions for my five year anniversary and finally one titled ‘My Big List of Point n’ Clicks!’

What’s that all about?

Well it turns out it’s not actually that old, especially compared to the other ones. Back in October 2019 I realised I had lost my hefty list of point n’ click Let’s Play suggestions. Years in the making that was and I must have foolishly deleted it. What’s the advice about having things backed up in three different places? Pfft, waste a time I tells ya.

Anyway I set up a Google Form and asked for all you lovely lot to send in suggestions to rebuild my list. And I now realise, almost four years later, that:

a) I never shared any of the results
b) I mostly kinda forgot these suggestions existed and did my own thing

Oops.

How careless of me! Well it’s time to put things right...at least a little. Because I thought it’d be interesting to see what was suggested back then and what I’ve actually played in the time since. Perhaps inadvertently I’d fulfilled all the suggestions and made everyone happy? Not quite.

There were 58 responses in total and after I cleaned up some of the entries and grouped them together, this is how it all stands:

Pretty interesting, eh? What sticks out to me is the overwhelming number of suggestions for Thimbleweed Park. Though it does make sense - back then it would have only been a couple of years old as well as being the exciting return of Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick working together. And hey I must have listened a bit because not long afterwards in May 2020 I started a Let’s Play of it.

Other popular suggestions are the genre classics - Broken Sword, Sam & Max and Grim Fandango. But sprinkled in amongst them are lots more, some I recognise and some I’ve never heard of. The good news is that I was partly correct in inadvertently fulfilling some of these. Scratch that, quite a lot I’d say. Sure, some are livestreams rather than full blown Let’s Play series but I think that’s fine? If you’re wondering...

That being said, there’s still lots that I still haven’t got around to - Deponia for example is one that has been in my Steam library since at least 2014 ready to go! Maybe one day I’ll finally get around to it.

The [form is still open](https://forms.gle/g8f9ipcjADRq1bE56) if you feel inclined to suggest a game. Perhaps in four years time I'll take a look and realise I’ve since played it...
